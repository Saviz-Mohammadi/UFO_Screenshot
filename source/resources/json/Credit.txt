Quick Tips:

1- For each category, it is better to use white text for number 7 and above as the foreground.

2- All categories start from their lightest version to their darkest. So, for white this means that "White_1" will be pure white and keeps getting darker as your travers. For Black, "Black_1" will be the lightest and becomes darker as you tarvers.
